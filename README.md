## Project: Deploying a Sentiment Analysis Model

Project for Udacity's Deep Learning Nanodegree program. In this project, I developed a deep learning model using Pytorch to analyze the sentiment of movie reviews with AWS, then proceeded to use AWS for deploying the model.

In order to complete this project, I used the GPU enabled workspaces within AWS.

### Install

This project requires **Python 3.x** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [os](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html)
- [glob](https://docs.python.org/3/library/glob.html)
- [sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
- [nltk](https://www.nltk.org/)
- [re](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html)
- [bs4](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/)
- [pickle](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html)
- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Counter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.Counter)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)
- [sagemaker](https://sagemaker.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
- [torch](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/index.html)
- [argparse](https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html)
- [json](https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html)
- [sys](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html)
- [sagemaker_containers](https://github.com/aws/sagemaker-containers#sagemaker-containers)
- [boto3](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/index.html)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute an [iPython Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)

I recommend installion [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads), a pre-packaged Python distribution that contains all of the necessary libraries and software for this project.

### Code

Template code is provided in the `SageMaker Project.ipynb` file.

### Run

In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory `Deploying-a-Sentiment-Analysis-Model/` (that contains this README) and run one of the following commands:

```bash
ipython notebook "SageMaker Project.ipynb"
```  
or
```bash
jupyter notebook "SageMaker Project.ipynb"
```

This will open the iPython Notebook software in your browser.

### Data
The movie review dataset used for this project are too large to upload to Github; thus, the dataset used for this project can be downloaded by following this [link](http://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/).
